# Tokenomics FAQ

## How do I buy CETI?

To start with, as with anything in crypto, first slow down, double check the address, and be sure you know what you’re buying. Here is the official token address for CETI: 

0x1bFCe574dEFf725A3f483C334b790E25c8FA9779

If you want to buy CETI our highest liquidity pair is CETI/wTAO on Uniswap v2. You can see the trade history and execute a trade on [dextools](https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x1140201364600b0016f35c5dd32e2269229ac3d6?t=1735008771474).

If you don’t have wTAO to buy with, we suggest first trading for wTAO using USDC or ETH. wTAO is just TAO bridged to Ethereum and wrapped in an ERC-20 interface. If you try to trade ETH directly the Uniswap router may try to use the highly illiquid and not supported CETI/ETH pair.

Furthermore, we don’t suggest using the official Uniswap frontend for this because that incurs an additional and completely avoidable fee. It will work of course, but we want you to get as much CETI as you can for what you spend.

## Why is there a tax?

The purpose of the ceτi AI project is to acquire hardware and plug it into decentralized physical infrastructure projects (DePin). To source the capital for that hardware we have two options. We could either take a share of the revenue or we could sell tokens. We’ve already promised 100% of the net revenue to CETI holders; so token sales are our only option. Where do we sustainably get the tokens to sell? We could either use inflation, or we can sell tax reserves. Inflation is a tax paid by everyone via debasement. Taxes are more strategic. They extract value from arbitrage bots and people chasing token appreciation on short time horizons and remove the burden of inflation from people here for the long term. Therefore, taxes are the most ethical and value aligned option available to us to fund the purchase of hardware. They aren’t going away until we find a better solution to sustainably source tokens.

## Why is the slippage so high?

There are two common reasons people ask this. First, they are being routed through the ETH/CETI pair which is highly illiquid. Second, the tax directly affects the minAmountOut parameter for your trade and this is being perceived as slippage when it really isn’t.

## When will you list on a CEX?

Any CEX adoption will be unofficial at best and undermine the ceτi AI project at worst. CEX transactions happen off chain and therefore don’t execute the tax logic in our smart contract. We are not interested in pursuing CEX listings. This token may not be the easiest to buy but we would rather maximize mission alignment for our holders than ease of access. Ultimately, people should come for the mission and for the APR. People buying CETI on a CEX would be participating in neither; they are just speculating.

## Can I farm points? When airdrop?

Most tokens that do airdrops have working products they are distributing some kind of control over (governance tokens). CETI is not a governance token and until the pilot hardware had no functional product. We needed to launch the token to gather mission-aligned holders who wanted to contribute to decentralizing AI. If that sounds like you, you can contribute to the cause by buying CETI and joining the revenue share program when it’s launched.

## What does the CETI token do?

100% of net revenue earned from the ceτi AI project will eventually go to the revenue share system. The CETI token will be required to participate in this system. Participants in the revenue share system will also be providing any DePin collateral the ceτi AI project needs to deploy hardware to our DePin partners. Details will be provided soon in the whitepaper.

## How do I stake CETI? When revenue-share?
You cannot currently stake CETI. Design and development of the revenue share system is ongoing. Design and participation details will be provided soon in the whitepaper.

## What is the intelligent compute fabric?

The intelligent compute fabric is analogous to DEX Aggregators like Matcha, 1inch, or Cowswap or Yield Aggregators like Yearn, Harvest, or Beefy. We will empirically measure the returns of deploying hardware to various DePin partners and dynamically reallocate hardware to optimize our returns. Longer term we will open up our intelligent compute fabric to add capacity for external hardware providers to add their compute to the resources our intelligent compute fabric will manage.

## How high could CETI go?

Our unique tokenomic flywheel design guarantees a certain ratio of operational capital to market cap. Since operational capital generates revenue, the yield should remain competitive at any market cap. Therefore CETI can only be overpriced if ceτi AI project has successfully saturated DePin demand for enterprise grade hardware. This is discussed more in our litepaper. Give it a read! 

To understand the scale and ambition of this project consider what the competition is doing today. Tech oligarchs have already invested hundreds of billions of dollars into enterprise grade hardware such as CETI is acquiring just to support the current demand for AI. We expect this demand to continue to expand exponentially in the coming years and for DePin compute demand to rival that. Projecting current trends, compute saturation won’t occur until there is hundreds of billions of dollars of operational capital in DePin and a PE multiple of that in market cap of infrastructure providers such as the ceτi AI project. This is one of the few trillion dollar opportunities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

## When will you have a whitepaper?

While we are steadily designing and developing the various systems that the whitepaper will document, our current priority is getting our pilot launch infrastructure up and running. Add several dedicated weeks of document review on top of our mining estimates for a whitepaper release estimate.

## Why isn’t liquidity locked?

Liquidity is not locked because CETI operates with a transparent and community-driven approach, utilizing multisig wallets to ensure security and accountability. Instead of locking liquidity, we focus on building trust through responsible management of funds and operations. This approach allows flexibility in scaling our infrastructure and addressing future needs without being constrained by locked liquidity
