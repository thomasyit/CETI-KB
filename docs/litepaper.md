# Overview

At ceτi AI, our mission is to accelerate the advancement of decentralized artificial intelligence. In pursuit of this goal, we build globally distributed, high-performance, scalable AI infrastructure for developers and decentralized AI networks that enables them to rapidly outpace the capabilities and reach of centralized AI. Through partnership and technical innovation we are committed to improving the accessibility of AI, the efficiency of AI infrastructure, and contributing to the growth of a more decentralized and diverse AI ecosystem.

# The problem with centralized AI today

We have assembled here, as futurists, builders, creators, and visionaries, who, at our core, hold the conviction that the inexorable creation of artificial general intelligence will engender a flourishing of human potential and the elevation of human civilization to unprecedented heights. However, the advancement of artificial intelligence toward this outcome currently confronts three significant challenges that demand our attention:

# Centralization of infrastructure

The current concentration of AI infrastructure in the hands of a few large tech companies presents a significant challenge for the broader AI ecosystem. This centralization not only creates barriers to entry for independent developers, researchers, and startups but also consolidates control over the direction and priorities of AI development. It limits access to high-quality computing resources to a select few, hindering innovation and progress in the field.

# Inefficient resource utilization

Existing AI infrastructure is characterized by significant inefficiencies in how resources are allocated and utilized. Despite the immense computing power available, much of it is underused or locked into silos, inaccessible to those who could leverage it for groundbreaking research or applications. This inefficiency leads to inflated costs, waste, and an overall slower advancement of the industry.

# Centralization of development

The development of AI technologies is predominantly centralized, with major projects and initiatives being driven by the same entities that control the infrastructure. This centralization stifles the growth and diversity of AI applications by limiting the perspectives and approaches that are brought to bear on AI problems. It narrows the field of innovation, privileging certain types of solutions over others, and reduces the opportunity for breakthroughs that could come from a more diverse set of contributors.

# The solution

Infrastructure that connects every human with every AI, everywhere in the world
The ceτi AI solution to centralized infrastructure is to build a globally distributed, high-performance, scalable AI infrastructure network that democratizes access to compute. This approach breaks down the barriers erected by the centralization of infrastructure, allowing independent developers, researchers, and startups to access state-of-the-art computing resources. Global distribution ensures that these resources are not only available to a wider audience but also resilient and capable of meeting the demands of various AI applications.

# Infrastructure that is itself, intelligent
The ceτi AI solution to inefficient resource utilization is to create a cloud compute layer that intelligently allocates and maximally utilizes all available resources in the ceτi AI Infrastructure Network. Our ceτi AI Intelligent Compute Fabric optimally matches unused computing power with both developers and decentralized AI networks. By optimizing the overall use of resources across the network, ceτi AI produces economically useful work at all times, reducing waste, and lowering the barriers to entry for AI development, thereby accelerating innovation and reducing costs for everyone.

# Infrastructure that is purpose-built for accelerating decentralized AI
The ceτi AI solution to centralized AI development is to foster a more diverse and innovative development ecosystem by using the ceτi AI Infrastructure Network and Intelligent Compute Fabric to power decentralized AI networks such as Bittensor, Render, Akash, and more. Our solution allows developers from around the world to contribute to and benefit from AI advancements, regardless of their affiliation with major tech companies. It encourages a multitude of perspectives and approaches to AI problems from a variety of decentralized communities, enhancing the diversity of AI applications and promoting breakthroughs from unexpected quarters.
